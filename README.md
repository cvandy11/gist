# React/Webpack Skeleton #

This is a basic starter boilerplate for webpack/react dev environments built with hotloading.

## Installation ##
1. clone the repo
2. navigate to the directory
3. use 'npm install' to install all dependencies needed

## Usage ##
* Use 'npm start' to run the server on port 3000
* 'npm deploy' will build, minify, and uglify the app to /dist/
* 'npm lint' will lint the project

## Testing ##
Chai, Mocha, and Sinon are already included for testing purposes.
